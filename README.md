The increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related wellbeing issues, such as weight, diabetes, and heart illness, highlights the requirement for compelling devices to back people in keeping up an adjusted and sound way of life. For those at risk or diagnosed with diabetes, managing daily routines encompassing diet, exercise, and calorie intake can be especially challenging due to the need for customized resources. SweetLife addresses this gap by providing an intuitive, AI-powered application designed to analyze meal choices and recommend personalized healthy activities based on individual health requirements. By adapting to userâ€™s lifestyles, whether they are managing diabetes or pursuing general wellness, SweetLife aims to empower individuals to make informed, healthier choices every day, ultimately supporting them in preventing or managing health risks effectively. Additionally, the integration of social support features within the app will be explored to understand their role in motivating users to sustain healthy lifestyle changes. Another critical aspect is how the interface design accommodates users with varying levels of digital literacy, ensuring accessibility for all. Finally, a comparative analysis will assess the effectiveness of the SweetLife app for diabetes monitoring against traditional methods alone. By addressing these questions, SweetLife aims not only to enhance individual health outcomes but also to contribute to a broader understanding of technology's role in promoting sustainable lifestyle changes.
